# MOSFLA
multi-objective shuffled frog leaping algorithm  
The author developed a novel MOSFLA for multi-objective optimization, and the testing function is ZDT-1.  
Author is a PhD cadidate majoring in environmental science, and researchgate is: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guowangchen-Liu  
If you want to use this algorithm for mathematical calculation, please cite my publication:  
A fast and robust simulation-optimization methodology for stormwater quality  
DOI: 10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.06.073  
Finally, I am especially grateful to Li et al., his article: Novel Multiobjective Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm with Application to Reservoir Flood Control Operation  
gives me good inspiration and optimization idea.
